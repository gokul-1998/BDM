### Micro and Macro Economics
* -> any economy has 5 activities that happen simultaneously
    - Production
    - Consumption
    - Exchange -> commodity to commodity or C to Money
    - Distribution
    - Investment
* -> they drive the economy.All these are inter-related.If one is stopped ,all the others will also be affected.
*  -> They are in two levels:
*  ---> micro-decision making level (houshold,individual,firm) =micro echnomics
*  ---> aggregates ,state or country or global or sector level =>macro economics
* -> price is micro and macro.it is the variable that links both 
* ->Both micro and macro both read data
### production,consumption and exchange

#### production
* ->process of converting raw materials into useful good/service
* -> process of value addition
* -> goods and services once when it is produced, they become consumable,because they acquire utility value
*  -> utility of a product will vary from one person to another.
*  -> producers have very limited capital resources
*  -> agrarian economy -> produces agriculture goods more
*  -> capital available and price matters
#### consumption
* -> using a product i achieve a satisfaction.
*  -> income and price matters
*  -> consumption is central in term of production.
*  -> there would not be production if there was no consumption
*  -> consumer has limited income but unlimited wants.
*  -> consumption basket(CB) -> goods consumer buys with his income. and it keeps changing.
*  -> when income changes, tastes and preferences will change.
*  -> when time change ,location changes CB changes
#### Exchange
*  -> sale and purchase of commodities. 
### consumption baskets

* -> everyone consumes so many things
*  -> 3 different expense data.

#### SURVEY DATA
* -> survey is from a sample representing entire population.
* -> from different strata like regions,income,occupation.
* -> bias time of survey.all data to be taken at same time.
* -> we cant recall last 3 months of expense.
* -> urban vs rural
#### utility and prices
* -> what drives consumers choice? -> utility
* -> what i can afford -> budget constraint and total utility.
* -> utility is also a function of price 
* -> prices could be skewed 
*  ->we need a theory to look at demand in terms of individual level or household or market level.

#### other sources of survey data
* -> longitudinal data => same household surveyed again and again.
* -> time-series => overtime a variable what is happening(GDP)
* -> cross sectional -> happeneing at a particular time.
* ->old timeseries and cross sectional => panel data-> polling observations overtime.
